        <p>At Builder Professional, we know what a website means to you and your business. Your
          website projects your work to the public, markets your brand, and showcases your craftsmanship. Those
          are all important, but many times your website will also be your first impression, the one you can
          never take back.</p>

        <p>A Builder Professional Artisanal Site is designed specifically for your business to
          ensure that every first impression is the lasting impression that turns every potential customer into
          a convert. Instead of a website that you have to manage on your own, the Artisanal Site is a
          relationship that puts our expertise to work for you on a continuing basis.</p>

        <p>First, you pay a minimal setup fee of $500 for your whole website. There are no add-on
          prices for additional modules or pages. All required programming and pages are included. Once your initial
          graphics are completed, you pay $150 per month as long as you want to stay with us. We're betting
          you're going to stay with us a very long time.</p>

        <p>When you build a new home and want to show off your latest and greatest, just get
          us the photos. We'll get them sized, oriented, and beautifully placed into your site. When you have
          a great customer testimonial, just get it to us, we'll get it featured to show off the great work
          you are doing. When you forge a great new partnership, just let us know the details and we'll get
          a write up and links to make the most out of your relationships. We do all this making sure that
          your website never looks out of date, never looks rushed, and never looks anything but first class.
          Plus, all of this is 100% included in your fee, you are never up-sold or charged extra. For your
          Artisanal Site, nothing but the best is good enough for you, and nothing but the best is good
          enough for us either.</p>

        <p>I believe your business deserves an Artisanal Site that projects what you and your
          business are capable of, and I can't wait to make sure your business gets one.</p>
